# DECISIONS drafts - staging (`worktree-staging`)

Entries for `DECISIONS.md`, newest first, each written exactly as it should
land (the `decisions-entry` format). Cleanup folds them in when the owner
hands the drafts off, then deletes this file (owner, 2026-09-30).

### 2026-10-03 - Mendoza's placement measured: every business has a point; Band A

- **The owner approved the download** ("1 yes"): `comercios_limpio.json`,
  12,239,392 bytes, sha256 `ca6af57c...707fd17`, cached at
  `data/mendoza/raw/comercios_limpio.json` (gitignored).
- **Measured (gate peak 0.01 GB):** 41,179 activity rows, 8,309 distinct
  `comercio_id` (the CSV's count; at most 30 activity rows per business).
  Fields: `comercio_id`, `nombre_fantasia`, `calle`, `numero`,
  `tipo_actividad`, `desc_full`, `fecha_inicio`, `x`, `y`. **Every business
  has a nonzero x/y (8,309, 100%)**; read as Gauss-Krüger zone 2 (EPSG:5344
  and 22182 agree within 0.0001 degrees), the median falls at the city
  centre and all 8,309 sit inside a rough box around the capital. The build
  checks against the department's own boundary.
- **Mendoza to Band A** on the owner's call of the same evening (the capital
  alone, seven stations). The JSON is the build's source: it carries the
  points and the activity rows together.
- **Privacy flag for the brief:** `nombre_fantasia` holds a sole trader's own
  name in the surname-comma-forename form on some rows, so the build's
  privacy check and a name rule (Vancouver's, 2026-09-21) apply.
- **Probe slip:** reading the file's first 200 bytes to confirm its shape
  printed one row to the console, and that row's trade name is a person's
  name. Nothing was written to a file or a doc. The rule (never print a row
  from a register that names people) holds; the next read of a new file
  prints field names only.

### 2026-10-03 - Mendoza approved for a build: the capital alone, seven stations (owner)

- **The owner: "mendoza can be built"**, answering whether a seven-station
  map is worth building. The Metrotranvía has 25 stations; 7 are in the
  Ciudad de Mendoza (capital department), about 8 in Godoy Cruz, 5 in Las
  Heras and 5 in Maipú. Every 7 minutes at peak and 11-12 off-peak, on a
  converted railway with stops about 700 m apart: it passes the light-rail
  test, so it is not a tram question.
- **Scope: the capital alone.** No neighbouring department publishes a
  business register (Godoy Cruz publishes monthly totals only).
- **The business leg:** "Listado Comercios por Actividad 2025", 8,309
  businesses (41,179 activity rows), all active as of June 2025, CC BY 4.0.
  First mapping at the business-type level: Retail 3,350, Food 721, Personal
  services 331; catch-alls 601 (mostly offices); 3,155 out of scope.
- **Open:** placement. The CSV has no coordinates; `comercios_limpio.json`
  (12,239,392 bytes) carries x/y in Argentina's zone-2 grid (POSGAR), fill
  rate unmeasured. Mendoza goes to Band A when placement measures.

### 2026-10-03 - Probe slip in the Mendoza screen: a whole file arrived from a 4 KB request

- **The screen asked Mendoza's open-data host for the first 4 KB** of the
  capital's "Listado Comercios por Actividad 2025" CSV, to read its header.
  The server ignored the Range header and sent the whole file (7.9 MB). No
  download beyond the two Belgian files had been approved.
- **Where it sits:** the staging scratchpad only, never `data/` or the
  repository. The screen's Mendoza counts (8,309 businesses, all active as
  of June 2025) come from it. Raised with the owner the same evening.
- **The lesson:** a Range request is not a header read; a server may ignore
  it. Read the schema from the catalogue's metadata or a records API, or
  stop the transfer by byte count in the script.

### 2026-10-03 - The sweep's first group screened, two Belgian downloads, Belgium off the ruled-out list (owner)

- **The owner: "all three approved"**, the three calls staging put after the
  coverage sweep, each as recommended:
  1. **Step 0 screens for the first group**: Daejeon, Gwangju and Gimhae
     (Band R on a stale reason: SEMAS's keyless national file, cached since
     2026-09-29, holds Daejeon 80,704 rows and Gimhae 26,700; Gwangju sits in
     the merged member 전남광주통합특별시), Liverpool (never recorded; the
     FSA steps carry over, Merseyrail meets the commuter-rail test or not),
     the City of Brussels (hub.brussels's shop inventory, 6,880 points, CC BY
     4.0), Mendoza and Tacoma.
  2. **Two downloads approved**: the FAVV operator list
     (`inter_actieve_actoren_EN.csv`, 87.9 MB, static.favv.be), to measure
     its join to Flanders' VKBO for Antwerp and Ghent; and Wallonia's
     `LOGIC_2024_GEOPACKAGE_3812.zip` (3.2 MB, geoservices.wallonie.be), for
     Charleroi and Liège.
  3. **Belgium leaves "Countries ruled out"** once the Brussels screen
     confirms the inventory. The ruling ("bulk access paid") rested on one
     national method and is out of date: KBO/BCE's open data file is free
     behind a free account (a Band D act for the owner), and only the Public
     Search web service is paid.
- **Not approved by this**: registering any account, including KBO's; a
  download the screens find beyond the two named goes to the owner first.

### 2026-10-03 - A coverage sweep before any new screen, Belgium's cities first (owner)

- **The owner: "yes start"**, on staging's recommendation, with the
  candidate list about to empty when Japan wave 2 lands (158 built, 0
  candidates).
- **Why a sweep first:** a spot check of about 60 cities with rail against
  the list found two kinds of hole. **Belgium is ruled out on one national
  method** (KBO/BCE bulk access is paid), the shape the 2026-09-24 audit
  reversed for eight countries; Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent and Charleroi were
  never screened at city level. **Six rail cities appear nowhere** in the
  list, its evidence file or the country shortlist: Jerusalem, İzmir, Quito,
  Almaty, Yerevan and Košice.
- **The sweep:** agents compare the world's metro, light-rail and tram
  systems against every row (built, Band R, discards, countries ruled out,
  the commuter-rail group), by region, and Belgium's cities get a Step 0
  read of their own catalogues. Catalogue and dataset-page reads only; a
  bulk file goes to the owner first. A city the sweep finds is screened
  normally afterwards.
- **Ranked below it, not started:** a third Japanese wave, the commuter-rail
  group (staging's lean: keep the rule) and Band R re-checks.
